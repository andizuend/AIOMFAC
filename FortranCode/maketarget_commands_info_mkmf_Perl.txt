# Below is the Terminal command line to produce a Makefile using the Perl script 
# on a Linux machine (when located in the Fortran code folder).

# Also: on CentOS 7 (i.e. RedHat-based, but not on Debian-based linux), execute the following command first:  
scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
or with newer version 10:
scl enable devtoolset-10 bash
# this is necessary if otherwise an older gfortran version is used (often version 4.8.5); 
# with the above command, you get a much more recent gfortran version ( >= 7.x), which is what we need. See also: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_toolset/8/html/user_guide/chap-gcc .
